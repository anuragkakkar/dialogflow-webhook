# dialogflow-webhook
This is a simple code for webhook. 
It can extracts information either from the database or from another webservice (Prestashop webservice in this case).

It is written in python and it is using flask framework.
Also the database is an open-source relational database management system called MySQL. (You might have heard of it)

All the changes about the database on your local machine can be made in config.py file.

At the end run the run.py file and go to port number 9090 on your localhost.

P.s You can use ngrok for tunneling and adding the resulting URL in your bot.
